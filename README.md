# ParkingShark
This is basically a SaaS that helps the users , basically commuters, to reserve parking slots in malls , even before they are there. This is built keeping in my mind the various challenges faced by people trying to park their vehicles in malls. The various pages in the interface implementation include signup page, login page, booking page and payment .
